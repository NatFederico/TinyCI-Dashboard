This Angular SPA gives the user the ability to connect an setup it's boards without any coding knowledge whatsoever.

## Tecnologies

This project runs on three AWS instances all running Ubuntu 22.04:
- The first one is running our MQTT broker, using Mosquitto, and AWS IoT Compatible.
- The second one is hosting our SPA running with NGINX.
- The third one is used for the compilation of the OTA.
Let's look more in depth to each one of these and the technologies they're running.
